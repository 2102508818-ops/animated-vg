# AnimatedVG

AnimatedVG is an open-source, cross‑platform editor for creating and editing Animated SVGs (SMIL). It’s built with Quasar (Vue 3) and runs on the web or as desktop apps using Tauri and Electron. The SVG is the single source of truth—no extra JSON sidecars—so your animations stay portable.
